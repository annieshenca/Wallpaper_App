Passion project of mine!

**Goal:**<br/>
Use AppleScript.<br/>
Fetch high-quailty public-accessiable images from National Geographic website, and set the image to my Macbook's wallpaper.

**Optional:**<br/>
Be able to modify image change time (per hour/day).<br/>
Be able to save image into Photo folder (through shortcuts or drop down menu).


**Plan:**<br/>
- [ ] Learn AppleScript.
- [ ] Figure out how to fetch an image from URL.
- [ ] Figure out how to change system settings to set new wallpaper in AppleScript.
- [ ] Connect the simple steps together.


...Let's figure this far first, then plan for more!
